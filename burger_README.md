# Is Your Burger Really Worth the Price?üçî 
This project aims to predict the fair price of "Patty Patty" (name of burger) from Pipit Burger in Seongsu, Seoul if the menu launches in the US 

## Goal
The goal is to predict the fair price of the burger using regression models, based on nutrition facts, length of menu, brand power index and other features

## Data Preprocessing
### Data Crawling
- Crawling
  Assuming ingredients and taste of every burger are indistinguishable, we crawled prices and nutrition facts of menus from nine well-known burger chain in the US
  (website : https://www.menuwithprice.com)
  
### Derived Variables
- Length of Menu
  - Assumption : The longer the length of menu is, the more price rises

- Proportion of patty, cheese and bun 
  - Assumption : Expensive burger contains A LOT of cheese, patty, and a small bun

- Price Range
  - low(< IQR 25)
  - mid(< median)
  - high(< IQR 75)
  - extra_high(> IQR 75)

### External Data 
- Brand Power Index
  - Calculated using sales, market share and units
  
## Modeling
- Following models were applied:
  - LinearRegression
  - DecisionTreeRegressor
  - RandomForestRegressor
  - GradientBoostingRegressor
  - XGBRegressor
- RandomForestRegressor performed the best

## Conclusion
- RandomForestRegressor was applied
- Menu : pipit double double burger from seongsu in South Korea
- Estimated price : $ 8.05($1.00 = 1,180 won) - 9,500 won
- Actual price : 9,500 won
- Price may change based on exchange rate but prediction was well-made!
